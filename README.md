## Eshton Martin

*Integrity. 
Service before self. 
Excellence in all that we do.*

I'm **Eshton** (אשטן), and my [pronoun.is/she](https://pronoun.is/she). Welcome to my GitHub home--there's no telling what you might find here!

I have a BA in **Psychology** from [City University of Seattle](https://www.cityu.edu) earned back in the stone age when almost no one outside the military had heard of **distance learning**, and I'm a [**Musician's Institute**](https://mi.edu) graduate, sometimes **web developer**, and nascient **graphic design** nerd.

Most importantly: ***I ❤️ dogs!***
