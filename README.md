## Eshton Martin

I'm **Eshton**, and my [pronoun.is/she](https://pronoun.is/she). Welcome to my GitHub home--there's no telling what you might find here!

I **teach ESL** and freelance in **data analysis** while dancing around the edges between **academia** and **journalism**. At the moment, I'm in the throes of a deep dive into [**Open Source Licensing**](https://choosealicense.com/appendix/) and corresponding best practices that include building a (probably unecessarily convoluted) open source **plain text writing** setup that I'll eventually document here. I'm also freshly enrolled in [**The Postdoc Academy**](https://www.postdocacademy.org/) althought I'm neither post- nor doc. I have BA in **Psychology** from [City University of Seattle](https://www.cityu.edu) earned back in the stone age when almost no one outside the military had heard of **distance learning**, and I'm a [**Musician's Institute**](https://mi.edu) graduate, sometimes **web developer**, and nascient **graphic design** nerd.

Most importantly: ***I ‚ù§Ô∏è dogs!***
